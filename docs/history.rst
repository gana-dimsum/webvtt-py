History
=======

0.4.2 (08-06-2018) Rename of modules and usability improvements
---------------------------------------------------------------

* Renamed and reorganized few of the modules
* Parsing methods are now class methods: read, from_srt and from_sbv
* Improved usability with the addition of shortcuts to avoid instantiating the classes so we can do:

import webvtt

webvtt.read('captions.vtt')  # this will return a WebVTT instance


0.4.1 (24-12-2017) Hot fix on cue identifiers
---------------------------------------------

* Support for saving cue identifiers

0.4.0 (18-09-2017) Refactor and parse compatibility
---------------------------------------------------

The main goal of this release is a refactor of the WebVTT parser to be able to parse easier and give support to
new features of the format.

New features:

* Support for cue identifiers
* Support for parsing WebVTT captions with comments
* Support for parsing WebVTT captions with Style blocks
* Support for BOM in caption files
* Added method to write the captions to an opened file
* Convert WebVTT to SRT format
* Ignore empty captions in SRT format

Other:

* Refactored WebVTT parser

0.3.3 (23-08-2017) Hot fix on cue tags
--------------------------------------

The text for the caption is now returned clean (tags removed). The cue text could contain tags like:
* timestamp tags: *<00:19.000>*
* class tags: *<c.classname>text</c>*
* and others...
**Important**: It currently removes any tag present in the cue text. For example <b> would be removed.

Also a new attribute is available on captions to retrieve the text without cleaning tags: **raw_text**

0.3.2 (11-08-2017) Hot fix for compatibility
--------------------------------------------
